	<p id="heading">I'm the type of person who plays music constantly - working, cooking, studying, endless. My Spotify ranked higher than 90% of listeners (supposedly...) for 2022. With that, comes my love for seeing it LIVE. I mostly stick to EDM b/c the community & people are incredible, but the music is also the best-worst-songs you'll ever hear.</p>

	<p id="P1">This was taken by yours truly at EDC Las Vegas 2022. It's one of the few places where the soundsystem literally rattles your bones & for someone who deeply loves music - it's amazing. I'd imagine it's the same feeling a movie buff feels when a blockbuster is finally released.</p>
