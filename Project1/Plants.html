	<p>I've always had a "green thumb", but as I've learned what plants work best with my lifestyle & skills, instead of aesthetics, it's gotten much easier!</p>
	<p>I've included basic information about each, from basic name to keeping info.</p>

<div class="P1">This is Maranta leuconeura. I've had this plant about two years & she's exploded growth. I've heard that any "Prayer Plant" is typically hard to keep, but I've had nothing put great progress. They enjoy high humidity & lots of shade.</div>

</div>
<div class="P2">This is a Dracaena marginata colorama (a mouthful right?), or Dragon Tree for short. This specific plant was a cutting from my father's plant & if you didn't know, propogated cuttings are genetic clones of the mother plant. To my partners' dismay, I really enjoy tree-keeping.</div>
