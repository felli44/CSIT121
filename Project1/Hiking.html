			<li id="VAList">I'm not sure if it's the calm waves that swam in or the crisp lakeside air, but the ambiance is nowhere near comparable to the lakes & reservoirs of Maryland. We didn't get to access parks by foot b/c of unforseen circumstances, but even from the parking lot it was stunning.</li>
