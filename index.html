      <p style="font-family: arial;">This is my favorite recipe as curry is typically a universally loved dish, but it also is easy to cook while leaving plenty for leftovers. Soups are definitely a staple food in a home with working owners!</p>
     <p style="font-family: arial;">Not only is this recipe easy, but it also is very friendly to alterations. Adding other vegetables, such as bell peppers, or spices such as cardamom or ginger, can really make it a show-stopper.</p>
